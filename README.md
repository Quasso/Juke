Juke
====

A Javascript jukebox that displays a feed of playable Spotify tracks from a user's Last.fm feed



It's in alpha but if people find it useful I will continue to develop. Currently only gels well with the '.user' method due to Last.fm's crazy API.

Drop the script in the head of your page, then check out the code in juke.html to see the syntax for adding a jukebox. It requires one line of code with some custom HTML attributes to configure user etc.
